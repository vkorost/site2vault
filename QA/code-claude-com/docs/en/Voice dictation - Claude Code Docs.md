---

```
/voice
```

, then either hold a key while you speak or tap once to start and again to send.

Voice dictation requires Claude Code v2.1.69 or later. Tap mode requires v2.1.116 or later. Check your version with

```
claude --version
```

.

## Requirements

Voice dictation streams your recorded audio to Anthropic’s servers for transcription. Audio is not processed locally. The speech-to-text service is only available when you authenticate with a Claude.ai account, and is not available when Claude Code is configured to use an Anthropic API key directly, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry. Transcription does not consume Claude messages or tokens and does not count toward the limits shown in

```
/usage
```

. See

[[Data usage - Claude Code Docs|data usage]]for how Anthropic handles your data. Voice dictation also needs local microphone access, so it does not work in remote environments such as

[[Use Claude Code on the web - Claude Code Docs|Claude Code on the web]]or SSH sessions. In WSL, voice dictation requires WSLg for audio access, which is included with WSL2 on Windows 11. On Windows 10 or WSL1, run Claude Code in native Windows instead. Audio recording uses a built-in native module on macOS, Linux, and Windows. On Linux, if the native module cannot load, Claude Code falls back to

```
arecord
```

from ALSA utils or

```
rec
```

from SoX. If neither is available,

```
/voice
```

prints an install command for your package manager.
The Claude Code

[[Use Claude Code in VS Code - Claude Code Docs|VS Code extension]]also supports voice dictation with the same Claude.ai account requirement. It is not available in VS Code Remote sessions, including SSH, Dev Containers, and Codespaces, because the microphone is on your local machine and the extension runs on the remote host.

## Enable voice dictation

Run

```
/voice
```

to enable dictation. The first time you enable it, Claude Code runs a microphone check. On macOS, this triggers the system microphone permission prompt for your terminal if it has never been granted.

```
/voice
```

accepts an optional mode argument:

Voice dictation persists across sessions. Set it directly in your

[[Claude Code settings - Claude Code Docs|user settings file]]instead of running

```
/voice
```

:

```
hold Space to speak
```

hint when the prompt is empty. The hint text is the same in both modes, and it does not appear if you have a

[[Customize your status line - Claude Code Docs|custom status line]]configured. Transcription is tuned for coding vocabulary in both modes. Common development terms like

```
regex
```

,

```
OAuth
```

,

```
JSON
```

, and

```
localhost
```

are recognized correctly, and your current project name and git branch name are added as recognition hints automatically.

## Hold to record

Hold mode is push-to-talk: recording runs while you hold the key and stops when you release it. This is the default mode. Hold

```
Space
```

to start recording. Claude Code detects a held key by watching for rapid key-repeat events from your terminal, so there is a brief warmup before recording begins. The footer shows

```
keep holding…
```

during warmup, then switches to a live waveform once recording is active.
The first couple of key-repeat characters type into the input during warmup and are removed automatically when recording activates. A single

```
Space
```

tap still types a space, since hold detection only triggers on rapid repeat.
Your speech appears in the prompt as you speak, dimmed until the transcript is finalized. Release

```
Space
```

to stop recording and finalize the text. The transcript is inserted at your cursor position and the cursor stays at the end of the inserted text, so you can mix typing and dictation in any order. Hold

```
Space
```

again to append another recording, or move the cursor first to insert speech elsewhere in the prompt:

```
Enter
```

. Set

```
"autoSubmit": true
```

in the

```
voice
```

settings object to send the prompt automatically when you release the key, as long as the transcript is at least three words long.

## Tap to record and send

Tap mode toggles recording with a single keypress: tap once to start, speak, then tap again to send the prompt. There is no warmup, and you do not need to keep the key held. Enable tap mode with

```
/voice tap
```

. With the prompt input empty, tap

```
Space
```

to start recording. The footer shows a live waveform while recording. Tap

```
Space
```

again to stop. Claude Code inserts the transcript and submits the prompt automatically when the transcript is at least three words long. Shorter transcripts are inserted but not submitted, so an accidental tap does not send a stray word.
The first tap only starts recording when the prompt input is empty, so you can still type spaces normally while composing a message. The second tap stops recording regardless of input contents. Recording also stops automatically after 15 seconds of silence or two minutes total.

## Change the dictation language

Voice dictation uses the same

setting is not in the supported list,

warns you on enable and falls back to English for dictation. Claude’s text responses are not affected by this fallback.

## Rebind the dictation key

The dictation key is bound to

```
voice:pushToTalk
```

in the

```
Chat
```

context and defaults to

```
Space
```

. The same binding controls both hold and tap modes. Rebind it in

[[Customize keyboard shortcuts - Claude Code Docs|:]]

```
~/.claude/keybindings.json
```

```
"space": null
```

removes the default binding. Omit it if you want both keys active.
In hold mode, avoid binding a bare letter key like

```
v
```

since hold detection relies on key-repeat and the letter types into the prompt during warmup. Use

```
Space
```

, or use a modifier combination like

```
meta+k
```

to start recording on the first keypress with no warmup. Tap mode has no warmup, so any key works. See

[[Customize keyboard shortcuts - Claude Code Docs|customize keyboard shortcuts]]for the full keybinding syntax.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when voice dictation does not activate or record:

- ```
  Voice mode requires a Claude.ai account
  ```

  : you are authenticated with an API key or a third-party provider. Run

  ```
  /login
  ```

  to sign in with a Claude.ai account.
- ```
  Microphone access is denied
  ```

  : grant microphone permission to your terminal in system settings. On macOS, go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone and enable your terminal app, then run

  ```
  /voice
  ```

  again. On Windows, go to Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone and turn on microphone access for desktop apps, then run

  ```
  /voice
  ```

  again. If your terminal isn’t listed in the macOS settings, see[[Voice dictation - Claude Code Docs#Terminal not listed in macOS Microphone settings|Terminal not listed in macOS Microphone settings]].
- ```
  No audio recording tool found
  ```

  on Linux: the native audio module could not load and no fallback is installed. Install SoX with the command shown in the error message, for example

  ```
  sudo apt-get install sox
  ```

  .
- Nothing happens when holding

  ```
  Space
  ```

  in hold mode: watch the prompt input while you hold. If spaces keep accumulating, voice dictation is likely off; run

  ```
  /voice hold
  ```

  to enable it. If only one or two spaces appear and then nothing, voice dictation is on but hold detection is not triggering. Hold detection requires your terminal to send key-repeat events, so it cannot detect a held key if key-repeat is disabled at the OS level. Switch to tap mode with

  ```
  /voice tap
  ```

  to avoid the key-repeat requirement.
- Tapping

  ```
  Space
  ```

  types a space instead of recording in tap mode: the first tap only starts recording when the prompt input is empty. Clear the input first, or check that you are in tap mode by running

  ```
  /voice tap
  ```

  .
- ```
  No audio detected from microphone
  ```

  : recording started but captured silence. Confirm the correct input device is set as the system default and that its input level is not muted or near zero. On Windows, open Settings → System → Sound → Input and select your microphone. On macOS, open System Settings → Sound → Input.
- ```
  No speech detected
  ```

  : audio reached the transcription service but no words were recognized. Speak closer to the microphone, reduce background noise, and confirm your[[Voice dictation - Claude Code Docs#Change the dictation language|dictation language]]matches the language you are speaking.
- Transcription is garbled or in the wrong language: dictation defaults to English. If you are dictating in another language, set it in

  ```
  /config
  ```

  first. See[[Voice dictation - Claude Code Docs#Change the dictation language|Change the dictation language]].

### Terminal not listed in macOS Microphone settings

If your terminal app does not appear under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone, there is no toggle you can enable. Reset the permission state for your terminal so the next

```
/voice
```

run triggers a fresh macOS permission prompt.

Reset the microphone permission for your terminal

Run

```
tccutil reset Microphone <bundle-id>
```

, replacing

```
<bundle-id>
```

with your terminal’s identifier:

```
com.apple.Terminal
```

for the built-in Terminal, or

```
com.googlecode.iterm2
```

for iTerm2. For other terminals, look up the identifier with

```
osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'
```

.

Quit and relaunch your terminal

macOS won’t re-prompt a process that is already running. Quit the terminal app with Cmd+Q, not just close its windows, then open it again.
